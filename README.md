# push_swap

## Description

**push_swap** is a C program that sorts a list of integers using a limited set of stack operations.  
The goal of the project is to produce the **smallest possible number of moves** to sort the numbers.

The program works with two stacks:
- **Stack A** (initial stack)
- **Stack B** (auxiliary stack)

Only specific operations are allowed (swap, push, rotate, reverse rotate), and each operation is printed to standard output.

These printed instructions represent the solution used to sort the list.

---

## Features

- Handles input validation and error management
- Detects already sorted lists
- Efficient sorting strategies for small and large inputs
- Outputs only valid push_swap instructions
- No memory leaks (checked with Valgrind)

---

## Allowed Operations

- `sa`, `sb`, `ss`
- `pa`, `pb`
- `ra`, `rb`, `rr`
- `rra`, `rrb`, `rrr`

---

## Usage

```bash
make
./push_swap 4 2 1 3
```
